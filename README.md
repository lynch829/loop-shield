# loop-shield
loop-shield is an active radiation shielding calculator that utilizes a monte carlo integration technique. the deflection of an incoming energetic particle (of specified Z and kinetic energy) due to a magnetic field generated from a current loop (of specified current and radius) is calculated. 

Improvements to be made: 
  -add heavy ions 
  -have equations checked
  -feed back deflection in steps
  -see if integration can be performed without monte carlo
